## Reason for Project

Try to implement this project in sprints - part of an agile workflow best practice. A sprint consists
of a scoped mini-project that focuses on one particular deliverable or feature. The work you do
lives on a specific branch; everything required to complete that deliverable is done on that
branch and then merged to the master branch when finished.
